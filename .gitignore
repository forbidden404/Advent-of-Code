# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However

## Documentation cache and generated files:

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# Rust
# Generated by Cargo
# will have compiled files and executables
/target/

# Remove Cargo.lock from gitignore if creating an executable, leave it for libraries
